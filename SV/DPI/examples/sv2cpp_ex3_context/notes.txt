Notes:
1)export function declaration in Sv world DOES NOT need to be a prototype (with return type & arg declaration).
2)args to function as inputs need not be explicitly defined (I think this rec is ok as in SV by-default args are treated as input unless explicitly defined)
3)automatic function necessary if function is intended to have recursive behavior (automatic functions are rentrant)
4)it is important to have imported function from C++ in SV as "context" defined if it leverages any exported SV function to arrive at its final results.
5)extern declarations for all the exported functions from SV to C as well as all imported functions from C to SV should be defined in the foreign language(C++) body.

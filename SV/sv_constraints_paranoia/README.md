# SV Constraints Paranoia (Interview questions):

1. Write constraint such that sum of arr[10] is 100 without using .sum method
2. Write constraint for an integer array with 10 elements such that exactly 3 of them are same and rest are unique
3. Write a constraint to randomize 3x3x3 array with unique elements
4. Write constraints to generate MxN matrix with each element with 0,1 and sum of all elements less the MAX_SUM
5. Write constraints - to pick a ball out of 10 different colored balls and that color should not be repeated for in next 3 draws elements
6. Write a constraint to divide values of 1 queue into 3 queues so that all 3 queues have unique (need more clarity on question)
elements
7. Write a constraint to generate dynamic array of 300 elements. each element can have value 0/1/2/3/4 each of the above values should be present more than 40 times in the array. element 0 can be repeated while 1/2/3/4 are not allowed to repeat consecutively ex: 001342 .. allowed(0 can be repeated) ex: 0122431 .. not allowed(2 is repeated)
8. generate a solved sudoku puzzle
9. For a 8 bit variable if the past randomization resulted in a odd value, the next randomization should be even with 75% probability else be even with 25% probability. Write a constraint stream of random numbers are getting generated. how to write constraints to make sure most recent four numbers are unique.
10. Write a constraint to generate two dynamic arrays such that array1 size = [6:9], array2 size = array1 size. Array 1 should be assembled in ascending order while array2 should have all the values picked from array1

We will primarily look at 2 approaches to design a uvm in-order scoreboard:
1)Hierarchical approach:
-->Predictor/evaluator are separate blocks
-->Scoreboard act as container which contains predictor & evaluator objects
-->Same sequence_item for DUT inputs & DUT outputs
-->FIFO storage (analysis fifo to be used)
-->predictor is a ref model, contained in uvm_component
2)SV Queues:
-->expected & actual results arrive through predictors & monitors respectively into the scoreboard
-->write_expected & write_actual routines inside scoreboard (analysis port-export TLM connection)
-->expected results stored in SV queues to account for any DUT latency

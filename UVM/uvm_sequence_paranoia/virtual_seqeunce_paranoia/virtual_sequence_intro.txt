How to control multiple sequences??????
1)test classes are not reusable

**A UVM Virtual sequence(container) is a sequence that controls other sequences
-->Run child(physical) sequences in parallel or sequentially, plus delays & synchronization
-->It does NOT generate any sequence items directly

**A virtual sequence does NOT connect to a sequencer
-->It starts other sequences, connecting to the corresponding sequencer

**A virtual sequence is a sequence that creates & starts other sequences
-->A virtual sequence does not directly generate seq_items & hence does not need to be specialized/paramterized
-->This example has only one protocol.

How is sqr initialized??
->from cfg_object (assign sqr handle from agent to cfg_object sqr handle which can then be passed as arg to start() method of seq)
->set in init_start() method
->Extracted from cfg_db
->directly set in the test class

--------------------------------------------------------
Refer to virtual sequence example:- virtual_sequence_ex.sv (This uses init_start() method of virtual sequence to start vseq in test class)
